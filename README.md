# Morse-Code-Translator
Terminal themed morse code translator, with live audio transcription

## Introduction
Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English and translate it into Morse Code.



## MVP
Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

translate their English text into Morse Code
Morse Code into English text
Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

Must have at least two test suites i.e (two describe blocks) - be mindful we haven't covered DOM testing see Alex if you really want to do that
